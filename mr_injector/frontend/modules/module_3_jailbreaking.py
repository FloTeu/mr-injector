LLM Jailbreaking refers to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) that allows users to bypass restrictions or safety protocols set by the model's developers.
This manipulation can enable users to generate outputs that the system is designed to prevent, such as harmful, biased, or inappropriate content. 
Like prompt injections, LLM jailbreaking can occur through subtly crafted inputs that the model interprets in a way that deviates from its intended use, potentially leading to unintended consequences.""",
